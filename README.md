Howdy!

I'm Lauren. I'm fairly new to coding, but after a whirlwind love affair with Java in college, I've been all about learning and devouring new languages. I've enrolled in a boot camp course at UC San Diego in order to satiate my hunger for MOAR CODE -- so far, so good. Once I start doing more interesting things in my course, I'll be making commits of them, so I have a record of my progress, and also because it's kind of like hanging doodles on the fridge. It will keep me accountable and also create pride in my work.

As far as non-coding interests, I'm a huge music fan (I love new wave, dark wave, post punk, industrial and goth, metal (especially math metal and stoner metal), and assorted indie (such as old school emo, chillwave, folk, etc)), and in my last life (as in, when I was in my 20s) I was a hairdresser and makeup artist. I still love those things, but only when I get to do what I want with them. After a decade of doing the things others want me to do, I've decided that any hair and/or makeup I do in the future will be on my terms, with my concepts. I enjoy things that are slightly off the beaten path -- I have green hair, and I get super starstruck around drag queens. I'm a HUGE fan of RuPaul's Drag Race. I'm also a burlesque perfomer, and a drag performer. Yep! I do male drag. It's a lot of fun, and it allows my inner theatre geek to come out and play. I also enjoy gaming, reading (mostly fantasy and sci-fi), Netflix binging, snorkeling and diving, and hanging out with my kitties and giant bunny.
