# hello-world
Just another repository (or is it?)

Howdy!

I'm Lauren. I'm a recent graduate of The Coding Bootcamp at the University of California, San Diego (quite recent -- July 8, 2017, to be exact!). My primary focus there was MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) stack development, however, I also learned a bit about MySQL, jQuery, HTML5, CSS (and other CSS goodies like Bootstrap and Sass), and LOTS of vanilla JS. I learned very basic Java in college, and plan to expand on my knowledge. I've also dabbled in ES6, and am beginning to learn Python, C#, and AWS. Be on the lookout for those repos!

As for non-coding interests, I'm a huge music fan (I love new wave, dark wave, post punk, industrial and goth, metal (especially math metal and stoner metal), and assorted indie (such as old school emo, chillwave, folk, etc)). I also enjoy gaming (MMOs, anyone?), devouring a good sci-fi or fantasy book, cooking, cleaning (yes, I'm one of those tidy weirdos), Netflix binging, snorkeling, and hiking. I'm a self-proclaimed bunny enthusiast, and I have two Flemish Giant rabbits to back up my claim to this title. I also have a couple of cats that love to help me code, and by help, I mean step on my keyboard.
